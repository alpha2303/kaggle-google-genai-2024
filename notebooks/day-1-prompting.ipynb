You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Every day was a parade of napping in sunbeams, demanding pets, and disdainful inspections of the birdfeeder. But one day, the aroma of adventure whispered on the wind, carried by the scent of freshly turned earth and distant wildflowers. Curiosity ignited, and Bartholomew, defying his inherent laziness, bolted out the cat flap, his purr a rumbling rumble against the silent morning air. \n\nHis first stop was the overgrown hedgerow. A flurry of feathers and anxious chirping caught his eye. A young robin, struggling with a plump worm, couldn't disentangle his wing. Bartholomew, always practical despite his adventurous nature, nudged the robin's foot gently, freeing it from its prickly predicament.  A chirp of thanks and the fluttering of delicate wings later, Bartholomew continued on.\n\nThe day unfurled in a series of exhilarating events. A family of squirrels, oblivious to Bartholomew's approach, led him on a daring race through a network of interwoven branches. He perched atop a towering oak, tasting the wind as he viewed his kingdom – a carpet of green stretching towards the distant horizon. He dodged a mischievous gang of street cats, exchanging snarls and brags. He chased a fat, slow-moving beetle through the garden maze, eventually capturing it – a gift for his adoring mother.\n\nBut the highpoint of his adventure, he soon learned, was not found in daring leaps or frenzied chases, but in quiet observation. Sitting under a star-studded sky, perched on a moss-covered rock, he felt the vastness of the world settling on him, a blanket of comforting magic.  He understood then that even adventure, while full of thrills and danger, held the possibility of new lessons and understanding.\n\nHis heart full of the sweet joy of a life truly lived, Bartholomew turned back towards the warm light of his home. The warmth that was no longer merely familiar but appreciated, longed for, and understood. He drifted through the catflap, tired,  and strangely content, and in the soft murmurs of  his familiar meow, he knew, with the certainty of the rising sun, that Bartholomew, the adventurous ginger cat, was home.  And this time, home was an even richer place than before. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.
